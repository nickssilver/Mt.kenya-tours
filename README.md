## Introduction
Tourism Management System is an integrated software developed for tourism business. It is a dynamic and responsive system
and it addresses the challenges of managing the records, missing records due to human errors, etc. The purpose is to build a
system that performs all operations related to traveling, booking, sightseeing, etc. This system connects customers and agents
directly, provides a feedback mechanism for tourists, maintains and controls the database of tourists’ information, and gives a
variety of travel services. 

## Conclusion
Tourism is currently recognized as a global industry that is growing at a high rate, like any other industry. 
This web-based application helps in maintaining the database. It has a friendly environment that connects customers willingly.
Thus, it simplifies the process by saving our time and efforts. It will help tour managers to control and handle the tour-related 
activities effectively and efficiently. A further modification could be possible where the system can be integrated with bigger 
organizations such as tourist agencies in order to help them.
